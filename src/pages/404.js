        This example demonstrates some of the core features of React Router
        including nested <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>s,{" "}
        <code>&lt;Outlet&gt;</code>s, <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>s, and using a
        "*" route (aka "splat route") to render a "not found" page when someone
        visits an unrecognized URL.
      </p>
    </>
  );

export default NoMatch;
